|10| [Siméon Denis Poisson][17] | Mathematics | *n/a* **³** | École Polytechnique | 1800 | [Joseph-Louis Lagrange][18], [Pierre-Simon Laplace][19] |

Academic genealogy prior to Poisson can be explored on the [Math Genealogy project][20].

**¹** After obtaining a Bachelor's Degree from Yale University, H.A. Newton did not pursue a Ph.D., as no American university offered a doctoral degree in 1850 [(Batterson 2008)][13]. In correspondence with Yale treasurer and librarian Edward Herrick, he notes attending Michel Chasles' lectures in 1855 at Sorbonne University, and mentions them as highly influential. Following the [Math Genealogy Project][14], I have included Chasles as his advisor.
Fun fact: when H.A. Newton joined Yale as faculty in 1855, he was the only professor in Mathematics at the university.

**²** Michel Chasles does not seem to have published a dissertation; [Michel and Smadja (2021)][16] indicate that his first published work was "Aperçu historique sur l’origine et le développement des méthodes en géométrie" in 1837.

**³** Soon after starting his university studies in 1798, Poisson was noted by Lagrange and Laplace, who became his mentors [(Connor and Robertson 2002)][21]. He graduated early in 1800, was hired as a teaching assistant (répétiteur). In 1802, he was named deputy professor at the École Polytechnique in 1802.

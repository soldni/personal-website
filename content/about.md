Hello ðŸ‘‹  My name is Luca Soldaini ([they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/them) or [he/him](https://pronoun.is/he/him)); I am an applied research scientist at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)][6] working on [Semantic Scholar][7].
My current research interests are question answering and information retrieval systems operating at scale.
Before joining AI2, I was an applied scientist at [Amazon Alexa][1].

I am also a core organizer at [Queer In AI][5], where I help with event organization, scholarship programs, and sponsors relations.

I obtained a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florence][3] in Italy, and I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Georgetown University][4].
During my doctoral studies, I investigated natural language processing techniques to improve access to medical literature for both medical professionals and lay people.

When not in front of a screen, I enjoy running, dreaming about utopian mass transit systems, and curating my ever-growing laptop stickers collection.

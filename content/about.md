Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Luca Soldaini ([he/him](/facts) or [they/them](/facts)) and I am a senior applied scientist at [Amazon Alexa][1] in [Manhattan Beach, California][2].
My current research efforts are focused on developing techniques for question answering at web scale; in particular, I am interested in building efficient ranking solutions and expressive generative models.

I am also a core organizer at [Queer In AI][5], where I help with event organization, scholarship programs, and sponsors relations.

I obtained a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florence][3] in Italy, and I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Georgetown University][4].
During my doctoral studies, I investigated natural language processing techniques to improve access to medical literature for both medical professionals and lay people.

When not in front of a screen, I enjoy running, dreaming about utopian mass transit systems, and curating my ever-growing laptop stickers collection.

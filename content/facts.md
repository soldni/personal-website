# Facts

In no particular order, here are some facts about me:

- My last name is pronounced *sol-dah-ee-nee*; stress is on the first *i* (`/solda'ini/` in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian)).
- My [Erd≈ës number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd≈ës_number) is 3: I coauthored at [least one paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16354-3_59) with Ophir Frieder, Ophir Frieder [wrote a manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207160211287) with Frank Harary, Frank Harary was [a collaborator](https://doi.org/10.1112/S0025579300005222) of Paul Erd≈ës.
- My [Bacon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) is 5 if you agree with [Saumya](https://x.com/saumyamalik44) that podcasts should count. [Nathan](https://www.natolambert.com) invited Olmo leads on [his podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS7QI99uJVc), Nathan [podded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1f-o0nqpEI) with [Lex Fridman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10253502), Lex interviewed [Kevin Spacey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey) [in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJTMQtE-MIo), Kevin co-starred with [Brad Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt) in [Se7en (1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_(1995_film)), and Brad was in [Sleepers (1996)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepers_(film)).
- Adding the two, my [Erd≈ës-Bacon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number) is 8. I would like a less cursed Bacon path üò¢ Do you have a spot for me in your next production?

Hello, visitor! üëã My name is Luca Soldaini and I use [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/them) pronouns.

<div id='about-me'>

Hats <span aria-hidden="true">üëí</span> I am currently wearing:

- **Senior applied research scientist** at the [Allen Institute for AI][6] on the [Semantic Scholar][7] team.
- **Core organizer** at [Queer In AI][5], where I help with event planning, scholarship programs, and sponsors relations.

Hats <span aria-hidden="true">üß¢</span> I have worn in the past:

- `2018-2021:` Applied scientist at [Amazon Alexa][1] working on question answering.
- `2013-2018:` Computer science Ph.D. student in the [Information Retrieval Lab][34] at [Georgetown University][4].
- `2009-2012:` B.Eng. student in computer engineering at the [University of Florence][3].
- `????-2009:` A [baby][12].

When not in front of a screen, I enjoy [brewing espresso][9], going on [runs][8], dreaming about utopian [mass transit systems][10], and curating my ever-growing [laptop stickers collection][11].
Raccoons are [the best][13].

## Research Interests

My current research is in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR).
In particular, I am interested in:

- [Building effective and efficient information systems](/research#eff-info-sys), for tasks such as information retrieval and question answering. Lately, I have been investigating **scientific literature** applications: How do academic researchers and practitioners look for information? How can we support them in processing literature more effectively?
- [Cross-language information ranking and selection](/research#cross-lang). Since the vast majority of online content is concentrated in **few languages**, how do we close the gap for those who **do not speak** them?
- [Generative models for improving presentation of information](/research#generation). How can we use natural language generation to **improve the output** of information systems?
- [Open source tools and data for NLP](/research#oss-nlp). I develop and maintain several tools and datasets that power my research and that I hope will be useful to others.

Please visit my [research page](/research) for more details!

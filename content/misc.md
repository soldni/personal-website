## Facts

In no particular order, here are some facts about me:

- My last name is pronounced *sol-dah-ee-nee*; stress is on the first *i* (`/solda'ini/` in [IPA][22]).
- My [Erdős number][23] is 3: I coauthored [at least one paper][24] with Ophir Frieder, Ophir Frieder [wrote a manuscript][25] with Frank Harary, Frank Harary was [a collaborator][26] of Paul Erdős.
- My [Bacon number][27] is 5 if you agree with [Saumya][28] that podcasts should count. [Nathan][29] invited Olmo leads on [his podcast][30], Nathan [podded][31] with [Lex Fridman][32], Lex interviewed [Kevin Spacey][33] [in 2024][34], Kevin co-starred with [Brad Pitt][35] in [Se7en (1995)][36], and Brad was in [Sleepers (1996)][37].
- Adding the two, my [Erdős-Bacon number][38] is 8. I would like a less cursed Bacon path 😢 Do you have a spot for me in your next production?
- Like [Helen][42], I enjoy building unnecessary things with machine learning.

|10| [Siméon Denis Poisson][17] | Mathematics | n/a**³** | École Polytechnique | 1800 | [Joseph-Louis Lagrange][18], [Pierre-Simon Laplace][19] |

Academic genealogy prior to Poisson can be explored on the [Math Genealogy project][20].

------

**¹** After obtaining a Bachelor's Degree from Yale University, H.A. Newton did not pursue a Ph.D., as no American university offered a doctoral degree in 1850 [(Batterson 2008)][13]. In correspondence with Yale treasurer and librarian Edward Herrick, he notes attending Michel Chasles' lectures in 1855 at Sorbonne University, and mentions them as highly influential. Following the [Math Genealogy Project][14], I have included Chasles as his advisor.
Fun fact: when H.A. Newton joined Yale as faculty in 1855, he was the only professor in Mathematics at the university.

**²** Michel Chasles does not seem to have published a dissertation; [Michel and Smadja (2021)][16] indicate that his first published work was "Aperçu historique sur l’origine et le développement des méthodes en géométrie" in 1837.

**³** Soon after starting his university studies in 1798, Poisson was noted by Lagrange and Laplace, who became his mentors [(Connor and Robertson 2002)][21]. He graduated early in 1800 and was hired as a teaching assistant (répétiteur). In 1802, he was named deputy professor at the École Polytechnique.
